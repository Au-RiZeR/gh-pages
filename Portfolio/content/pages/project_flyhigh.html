                    <p>
                        Fly-high Fishing was developed by a team of nine students over the course of 4 weeks. 
                        <br>
                        This was for our Virtual and Extended Realities subject where we were required to produce a game together for the Oculus Quest 2.

                    <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the biggest challenges that we as a team had to overcome was limited access to the Oculus Quest 2. 
                        <br>
                        Only two members had access to the VR headset, making it difficult to test and build as we had to wait for our schedules to line up.
